Capstone Project 1:
In this project, the following machine learning algorithms and techniques were applied:
1.	Decision Tree
2.	Random Forest
3.	XG-Boost
4.	ADA-Boost
5.	Logistic Regression
6.	Ensemble
7.	Bagging
8.	Feature Engineering

The code for the above-mentioned algorithms is shown in the notebook below:

Results:
After applying all the algorithms mentioned above on the default of credit card clients, XG-Boost was found to be the best to predict if the client will default or not. XG-Boost gave an accuracy of 82 %.
