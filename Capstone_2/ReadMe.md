Capstone Project 2 - Forecasting Anonymous Product demand 

In this project, the data for an anonymous product was provided by Southern Illinois University Edwardsville. The data includes five years demand data for the product. In this capstone, traditional time series forecasting technqiues were compared with deep learning time series forecasting. The traditional and deep learning techniques/ algorithms have be applied in the following order below. 

1. Simple Exponential Smoothing
2. Holt's Linear Trend
3. Holt's Winter Method
4. ARIMA
5. SARIMA
6. FBProphet 
7. LSTM nueral network
8. ConvLSTM neural network 


The code for the algorithms is provided in the notebook below:

Results: The RMSE for 
  Simple Exponential Smoothing is 24.81,
  Holt's Linear Trend is 19.61,
  Holtâ€™s Winter Method is 20.09,
  ARIMA is 19.45,
  SARIMA is 30.56,
  LSTM is 26.9,
  CNN-LSTM is 18.16.
